2. Functional Test Execution and Bug Report: Funcional test scenarios are executed manually on both Desktop and Mobile platforms for each new functionality. Any encountered bugs are promptly logged on JIRA and linked to the respective story and test scenario. Comprehensive test results are meticulously documented using Zephyr Scale.

3. Regression Test Execution: At the conclusion os each Sprint, regression test scenarios are manually executed on both Desktop and Mobile platforms. The outcomes of these tests are recorded using Zephyr Scale.
